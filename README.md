This repository contains solutions for all code programming assignment I solved as part of the ["Algorithms, Part I"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) cource offered by Princeton University at Courcera.

## About this cource

<em>
This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.

## Assignments List

##### **1. Percolation**  
**Goal:** Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation. [Check out the detailed specification.](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php)

##### **2. Deques and Randomized Queues**  
**Goal:** Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators. [Check out the detailed specification.](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php)

##### **3. Collinear Points**  
**Goal:** Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points. [Check out the detailed specification.](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php)

##### **4. 8 Puzzle**  
**Goal:** Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm. [Check out the detailed specification.](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle/specification.php)

##### **5. Kd-Trees**  
**Goal:** Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest-neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point).
